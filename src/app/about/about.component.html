          <p class="title">HTML/CSS</p>
          <p>Tangie is a LEO, silly, serious, and full of truth. She 
            enjoys watching her son play soccer, and swim competitively. She finds joy
            in traveling, being at the Ocean's edge and soaking in the sun.
            Weekends can be spent in solitude perusing the farmer's market and baking
            new treats. My secret indulgence includes pancakes. Something not many
            people may not know about me is that I have a background in Geographic Information
            Systems.

          <p class="title">Database</p>
          <p>Elissa Lappenga built her first database as a bright-eyed grad student and never looked back. She has achieved honorary Geek status in that she can tell a Hobbit from a Horcrux, but has never actually played Dungeons and Dragons. According to her kids, Elissa spends much of her spare time and energy looking for ways to ruin their fun and publicly embarrass them, usually under the guise of helping them become thoughtful, contributing members of society.</p>
