    <h1 style="text-align:center">Who We Are</h1>
    <p class="meet-team">On paper, the mix...is unusual. A body building champion, a bridal consultant, a mother of two,
      and a geographic information specialist. Yet they make up the team of VoceFemme - a team as diverse as the
      community we strive to create.</p>

          <p class="statement">Hailing from Grand Rapid and now in Detroit, Remi spends her days nestled with a good
            book or going on a hike with her fuzzy pup, Porter. In her off time from coding, she enjoys time with
            friends
            playing DnD, participating in weight lifting competitions or hanging out in the kitchen cranking out savory
            vegan curry recipes. </p>

          <p class="title">HTML/CSS</p>
          <p>Tangie is a LEO, silly, serious, and full of truth. She
            enjoys traveling, and being at the Ocean's edge and soaking in the sun. Interest in Computer Science started
            early when she got her first Tandy from Radio Shack. Weekends can be spent in solitude perusing the farmer's
            market and baking
            new treats.</p>

          <h3>Elissa Lappenga</h3>
          <p class="title">Database/API</p>
          <p>Elissa built her first database as a bright-eyed grad student and never looked back. According to her kids,
            Elissa spends much of her spare time and energy looking for
            ways to ruin their fun and publicly embarrass them, usually under the guise of helping them become
            thoughtful, contributing members of society.</p>

          <h3>Brit Shellenbarger</h3>
          <p class="title">Database/CSS</p>
          <p>Many describe Brit as someone who is always tinkering. She can often be found riding
            her road bike on the weekends or cooking up a storm in the kitchen. From an early
            age she dabbled with tech and generally nerd-ery as she built computers with her step-dad and emersed
            herself into WoW with her cousins.</p>
